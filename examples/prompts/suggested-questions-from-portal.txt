Below are concrete prompts you can send to the Azure OpenAI model router to nudge it toward different choices among GPT-4.1 series, o4-mini, gpt-5-chat, and gpt-5 reasoning. Actual routing can vary by your org’s settings and the router’s heuristics, but these patterns are good triggers.

Likely routes to gpt-5-chat (general conversation, polished writing, light coding)

Write a friendly email apologizing for a delayed shipment and offering a 10% coupon. Keep it under 120 words.
Explain vector databases to a product manager in plain English using three bullet points.
Brainstorm 12 catchy taglines for a new cold-brew coffee brand.
Improve the clarity and tone of this status update for executives; keep it concise and confident.
Refactor this short JavaScript function for readability and add brief inline comments. (paste 15–30 lines)
Likely routes to gpt-5 reasoning (deep, multi-step, or high-stakes tasks)

Design an O(n log n) algorithm to find the k closest pairs among n 2D points. Prove correctness and analyze time/space.
You’ll get a 2,000-word policy. Answer multi-part questions with precise citations to sections and page numbers. Prioritize accuracy over speed. (then paste doc)
Solve the classic 12-coins puzzle (one coin is odd, heavier or lighter). Give the minimal number of weighings and the decision tree.
Propose a statistically sound A/B test for a pricing change that might suffer from Simpson’s paradox. Specify metrics, segmentation, and tests.
Write a SQL query to compute cohort retention by signup month with edge cases (late activations, missing events). Explain logic and complexity.
Likely routes to o4-mini (fast, low-cost classification, extraction, short rewrites)

Summarize this email thread in exactly three bullets, each under 15 words. Speed over completeness. (paste thread)
Classify the sentiment of these 12 short reviews as POS/NEU/NEG and return JSON {id, sentiment}. (paste list)
Extract all dates, currency amounts, and counterparties from this 200-word contract snippet; output CSV with columns date, amount, counterparty. (paste text)
Translate these five sentences to Spanish, keep proper nouns unchanged, one line per sentence. (paste lines)
Rewrite this paragraph at a 6th-grade reading level, max 80 words, no jargon. (paste paragraph)
Likely routes to GPT-4.1 series (multimodal/vision or chart/diagram understanding)

From this receipt image, list items, quantities, unit prices, tax, and total as a table. (attach image)
Analyze this line chart image: summarize key trends, anomalies, and likely seasonality. (attach chart)
OCR this UI screenshot, list visible labels and buttons, and note accessibility issues. (attach screenshot)
From this scanned form, map fields into the given JSON schema; fill missing fields with null. (attach form + schema)
Describe this network diagram and identify single points of failure with mitigation suggestions. (attach diagram)
A/B prompt pairs that often flip routing

Speed vs depth
Fast: Summarize this 1,500-word article in 3 bullets; 75 tokens max; speed over completeness. (o4-mini)
Deep: Produce a structured summary with section references and a short critique; accuracy over speed. (gpt-5 reasoning)
Simple vs complex coding
Simple: Write a Python function to validate an email format and add 3 tests. (gpt-5-chat)
Complex: Design a distributed rate limiter for 50k RPS across 20 regions; discuss trade-offs and failure modes. (gpt-5 reasoning)
Text-only vs multimodal
Text-only: Explain what a candlestick chart represents to a beginner. (gpt-5-chat)
With image: Given this candlestick chart image, identify any head-and-shoulders pattern and justify. (GPT-4.1 series)
Tips to steer routing in your prompt

State constraints explicitly: “speed over completeness,” “accuracy over speed,” “budget-sensitive,” or “take your time.”
Signal modality by attaching images when you want multimodal handling.
Ask for rigorous, verifiable outputs (citations, proofs, decision trees) when you want deeper reasoning.
Keep tasks short and structured (classification/extraction/brief rewrite) when you want fast, low-cost handling.
If you want domain-specific examples (e.g., healthcare, finance, legal), tell me your domain and I’ll tailor prompts that reliably exercise different routes.
